    The research paper titled "KSR1 Knockout Mouse Model Demonstrates MAPK Pathway's Key Role in Cisplatin- and Noise-induced Hearing Loss" was authored by Maria A. Ingersoll, Jie Zhang, and Tal Teitz and published on March 21, 2024, in the Neurobiology of Disease. This study investigates the impact of the KSR1 gene on hearing loss. The abstract reveals that knockout mice devoid of the KSR1 protein exhibit resistance to cisplatin- and noise-induced permanent hearing loss compared to their wild-type counterparts. The KSR1 protein acts as a scaffold bringing MAPK pathway proteins (BRAF, MEK1/2, ERK1/2) in proximity for activation through phosphorylation cascades triggered by cisplatin and noise in cochlear cells. The knockout of KSR1 significantly reduces MAPK activation, thereby conferring hearing protection.

    Key findings include the role of MAPK pathway inhibition in providing hearing protection, with dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) effectively protecting KSR1 wild-type mice from hearing loss without additional benefits in KSR1 knockout mice. These findings suggest that dabrafenib primarily works through the MAPK pathway.

    Further details include the involvement of several key entities:
    - GO_0004672: Knockout of the KSR1 gene reduces activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is involved in cellular stress and death in response to cisplatin and noise exposure.
    - DOID_0050563: Genetic knockout of the KSR1 gene in mice confers resistance to noise-induced permanent hearing loss compared to wild-type littermates. KSR1 knockout mice had significantly less hearing loss, as demonstrated by auditory brainstem response, distortion product otoacoustic emission, outer hair cell counts, and synaptic puncta staining, compared to wild-type mice following noise exposure. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway, which includes BRAF, MEK, and ERK, was shown to be the mechanism by which KSR1 knockout mice were protected from noise-induced hearing loss.
    - CHEBI_75048: Dabrafenib is a BRAF inhibitor that protects against both cisplatin-induced and noise-induced hearing loss in mice by inhibiting the MAPK pathway. Dabrafenib is an FDA-approved drug, making it a promising compound to repurpose for the prevention of hearing loss.
    - L01XA01: Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent that can cause permanent hearing loss as a side effect. Cisplatin-induced hearing loss is associated with activation of the MAPK pathway, which leads to cellular stress and damage in the inner ear. Genetic knockout of the KSR1 gene, which is involved in the MAPK pathway, conferred resistance to cisplatin-induced hearing loss in mice. Additionally, treatment with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib, which inhibits the MAPK pathway, also protected against cisplatin-induced hearing loss.

    The study utilized various instruments and equipment (details not specified), and included the KSR1 knockout mouse model and wild-type littermates as subjects. Analytical methods involved single-cell RNA sequencing data from postnatal day 28 C57BL/6 mice to examine the expression of MAPK genes in the cochlea, and statistical analysis to compare hearing outcomes and MAPK signaling between KSR1 knockout and wild-type mice. Hearing function was evaluated using auditory assessments, and MAPK pathway activation in the cochlea was measured through biochemical assays.


    ** Notes **
    1. DO NOT USE ANY SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN THE SUMMARY. eg. :, ", newlines, etc.
    2. Ensure the summary captures all key entities and relationships present in the RDF JSON-LD graph.
